/**
 * ObjectCache is a minimal approach to cache objects (either many
 * object in a List or one single object).  
 * 
 * <p> We've seen a couple of frameworks to solve caching of
 * objects. The overhead of many of these are often too high to make
 * them understandable and in some cases useful for students. Perhaps
 * using a database is the proper way of doing this but we feel this
 * is way too much overhead.
 * 
 *
 * Check out [ADHD](https://github.com/progund/adhd), a tool with
 * which you can read out database and serialized files (ObjectCache)
 * from an Android device and create text and html from that. This is
 * useful if you want to see what's in your app's database etc on the
 * Android device.
